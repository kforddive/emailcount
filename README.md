# Email Count

Code for Google Apps Script to count Gmail emails I received yesterday. Designed to be run daily.

It is largely based on script from StackOverflow by Kristkun

This is the script for counting Inbox messages I received yesterday.
I decided to label all incoming mail "Received" - I did this so that if I change the status of an email to archive or otherwise move it out of Inbox on the day I receive it, it will still be counted.

Question: if I delete a message will it still be counted?

I also want to count all emails that I send.
I ultimately want to trigger it so it happens automatically each day or when I press a button.
